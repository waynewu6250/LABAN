We collected a total of 44783 annotations with 25 intents and 36 slots, randomly split into 31279 training, 4462 validation and 9042 test utterances.
The dataset has utterances that are focused on navigation, events, and navigation to events.
The median (mean) depth of the trees is 2 (2.54), and the median (mean) length of the utterances is 8 (8.93) tokens.
35% of trees have depth more than 2. The dataset has 4646 utterances that contain both navigation and event intents.
The training, evaluation and test sets are provided as tab-separated value (tsv) files.

Each row is of the format:
raw_utterance <tab> tokenized_utterance <tab> TOP-representation
where the TOP-representation is an annotated version of the utterance
e.g. Art fairs this weekend in Detroit <tab> [IN:GET_EVENT [SL:CATEGORY_EVENT Art fairs ] [SL:DATE_TIME this weekend ] in [SL:LOCATION Detroit ] ]
Opening of a non-terminal node is marked by "[" (part of the non-terminal label), while a closing is marked by a standalone "]"

The evaluation script can be run from evaluate.py (run with -h for options).
The script is compatible with Python 3.6 and above.
