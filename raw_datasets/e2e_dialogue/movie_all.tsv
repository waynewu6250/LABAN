246	10	2016-03-10T02:12:08.467Z	agent	As a gamelike, simulationist PG-13 horror chamber piece, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a success: well shot and -staged, arrestingly acted, edited with a crisp unpredictability. It's less compelling in terms of character and meaning. There's bite in Goodman's portrayal of an American classic, the troubled dude so thoroughly prepped for doomsday that he's clearly rooting for doomsday to come. But the character suffers from mystery-box plotting: To ensure we're always guessing, he can't just come out and tell Michelle, in the early scenes, what exactly is supposed to be going on. He's so slow to spill the basics of the scenario that you might think the marketing team has them under embargo even inside the movie itself.	inform(moviename=10 Cloverfield Lane;description=gamelike;mpaa_rating=PG-13;genre=horror)

Despite the comforts of home, Howard's controlling and menacing nature makes Michelle want to escape.

1709	2	2016-03-20T02:39:34.420Z	agent	There are two movies that are currently playing that Fandango has recommended for 'all ages'. They are Zootopia with a  description: Synopsis:  In a city inhabited by anthropomorphic animals who have abandoned traditional predator\/prey roles in favor of civilized coexistence, uptight rabbit police officer Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) is forced to work with charismatic fox con artist Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) to crack a major case involving the mysterious disappearance of some carnivorous citizens. But when a few of the missing critters reappear, having reverted to pre-enlightenment savagery, it exposes existing anti-carnivore prejudice among the city's herbivores that threatens to damage the fabric of their diverse metropolis. Shakira, Idris Elba, J.K. Simmons, Nate Torrence, Jenny Slate, Tommy Chong, Octavia L. Spencer, Bonnie Hunt, Alan Tudyk, Don Lake, and John DiMaggio also lend their voices. ~ Violet LeVoit, Rovi\r\n\r\nOr, Miracles From Heaven with a description: Synopsis: In this religious drama based on a true story, a mother (Jennifer Garner) is devastated to learn that her ten-year-old daughter Anna (Kylie Rogers) has an incurable digestive disorder that causes her chronic pain. But when Anna is mysteriously cured of the ailment following a serious accident in which she falls three stories, her mom begins to believe that her recovery is a miracle. Martin Henderson and Queen Latifah co-star. Directed by Patricia Riggen. ~ Jack Rodgers, Rovi\r\n\r\nIf either of these interest you, give me your city and state and I will see where they are playing in your area.	inform(theater=Fandango;genre=all ages;mc_list={moviename=Zootopia||actress={Ginnifer Goodwin#Shakira#Jenny Slate#Bonnie Hunt#Octavia L.

1774	2	2016-03-20T23:23:50.224Z	agent	I don't even know where to begin with this movie. Saw the screening last night and I am confused. The man that saves them is crazy, a killer and we still don't know what happened to his daughter, who the neighbor was that disappeared and why he wrecked into this woman's car. He gave somewhat of an explanation for why he wrecked her car but it still didn't make sense and then he would quickly change his explanation ending with BUT I SAVED YOUR LIFE. I still don't know what the attack was. Was it chemical (I doubt it based on how it ended), was it aliens or some unidentified monster (questionable because I still don't know what the monster was). It was like a cross between a Komodo Dragon and aliens from Independence Day. Then, what happened to everyone else, the girl's fiancee. Why did she decide to drive toward Houston to help people but she doesn't have any medical experience? I was really confused with the ending. I thought Cloverfield was set in New York?	inform(other=The man that saves them is crazy, a killer and we still don't know what happened to his daughter, who the neighbor was that disappeared and why he wrecked into this woman's car.

Excellent thriller with a great cast. It will have you guessing all along and it will make you jump off your seat more than a few times. Must watch on theaters. Don't wait for the DVD on this one.   Terrible movie that left a lot of questions unanswered By dlene06 Written March 20, 2016 I don't even know where to begin with this movie. Saw the screening last night and I am confused. The man that saves them is crazy, a killer and we still don't know what happened to his daughter, who the neighbor was that disappeared and why he wrecked into this woman's car. He gave somewhat of an explanation for why he wrecked her car but it still didn't make sense and then he would quickly change his explanation ending with BUT I SAVED YOUR LIFE. I still don't know what the attack was. Was it chemical (I doubt it based on how it ended), was it aliens or some unidentified monster (questionable because I still don't know what the monster was). It was like a cross between a Komodo Dragon and aliens from Independence Day. Then, what happened to everyone else, the girl's fiancee. Why did she decide to drive toward Houston to help people but she doesn't have any medical experience? I was really confused with the ending. I thought Cloverfield was set in New York?	inform(other=Wow, deceptively good)

But when a few of the missing critters reappear, having reverted to pre-enlightenment savagery, it exposes existing anti-ca ivore prejudice among the city's herbivores that threatens to damage the fabric of their diverse metropolis. Shakira, Idris Elba, J.K. Simmons, Nate Torrence, Jenny Slate, Tommy Chong, Octavia L.
